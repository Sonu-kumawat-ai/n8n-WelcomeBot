# n8n WelcomeBot

Welcome to the **n8n WelcomeBot** project!  

This automation system captures user data from a contact form, processes it using an AI model, and then automatically sends a personalized welcome email to the user‚Äôs Gmail account.

This project leverages **n8n**, an open-source automation tool, and **Google Gemini Chat**, an AI model, to create a seamless experience for new users who submit a form.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Contact Form Integration**: Users can submit a contact form with their details.
- **AI-Generated Welcome Message**: The AI agent processes the form data and generates a personalized welcome email.
- **Automated Email Sending**: The system sends the welcome message to the user's Gmail using the Gmail API.

## üîÅ Workflow Overview

This workflow consists of several key stages that automate the process of sending a welcome email:

### 1. Webhook Listener
- A **Webhook node** captures data submitted via the contact form (name, email, age, gender, country).

### 2. AI Agent
- The data is processed by an **AI agent**, which uses **Google Gemini Chat** to generate a personalized welcome message based on the form data.

### 3. Send Email via Gmail
- Once the AI generates the response, a **Gmail node** sends the personalized message directly to the user‚Äôs Gmail account.
